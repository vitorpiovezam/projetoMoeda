## St. Petersburg paradox simulated in Java


A casino offers a game of chance for a single player in which a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The initial stake starts
at 2 dollars and is doubled every time heads appears. The first time tails appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever
is in the pot. 

Thus the player wins 2 dollars if tails appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if heads appears on the first toss
and tails on the second, 8 dollars if heads appears on the first two tosses and tails on the third, and so on. Mathematically, the
player wins 2k dollars, where k equals number of tosses (k must be a whole number and greater than zero).

What would be a fair price to pay the casino for entering the game?
